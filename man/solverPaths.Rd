\title{Set paths to the executables of solvers only available in binary format.}
\usage{
solverPaths(paths = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{[\code{list}]\cr
Named list where each component indicates the path to the executable of the
corresponding solver. Supported solvers at the momenet are
\describe{
  \item{lkh}{Implementation of the Lin-Kernigham heuristic.}
  \item{eax}{Implementation of the evolutionary EAX algorithm.}
}}
}
\value{
[\code{list}] List of pathes. Used internally by \code{runTSPSolver}.
}
\description{
In the current version \pkg{salesperson} does not implement the source code
of some solvers including LKH and EAX, but calls the corresponding compiled
executables. Since the CRAN guidelines do not permit shipping binary executables
one has the download these by hand and tell the \pkg{salesperson} package about
the file path. This is done by the \code{solverPaths} function.
